JBoss Brings More Power to your Business Processes

A lot has happened in the Business Process Management area over the last few years, with the intro of the BPMN 2.0 standard, the
increasing interest in more dynamic and adaptive processes, integration with business rules and event processing, case management,
etc. In this session, we will show you how JBoss jBPM tackles these challenges, discuss migration to this new platform and give an
overview of its most important features.

Notes:
Speaker has been evangelizing OpenShift throughout Europe over the last year, speaking in Belgium, Luxembourg, UK and Germany on the
topic at both large conferences and smaller User Group meetings.
