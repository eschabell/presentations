Final questions for the course to get an idea on your general impressions of the JBoss BRMS tooling:
====================================================================================================

1) What is the one thing you would change about the tool?

Answer: Less clicking, when you have to fill in a literal value for a constraint you have to click to much

2) What or where was the biggest problem you had when using the tool?

Answer: You couldn't edit the source, and rules that caused firing each other (thus creating a loop)

3) Where is the biggest improvement that could be made?
   
Answer: Automatically save on closing of a tab (or at least a preference that enables this)

4) How was the documentation able to help?
   
Answer: Haven't used the documentation

5) Should their be self help, and what form would it take?
   
Answer: Don't know

6) Did you use any of the testing features, how did you like them, what could be improved?

Answer: It is not clear what the verify does, because sometimes a rule passes the verify, but gives an error on something else

7) What did you expect to be able to do that you couldn't?

Answer: In a model to reference to every object (now, you can only reference to earlier objects)

8) What was the biggest source of frustration?

Answer: Failure to save, private property error when you forget to write 'dialect "mvel"'
