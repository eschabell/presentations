Final questions for the course to get an idea on your general impressions of the JBoss BRMS tooling:
====================================================================================================

1) What is the one thing you would change about the tool?

Answer:
- Give the user suggestions when something is going wrong. The error messages are too cryptic right now.

2) What or where was the biggest problem you had when using the tool?

Answer:
- Out of memory exceptions, also causing the repository to corrupt.

3) Where is the biggest improvement that could be made?
   
Answer:
- Error messages that actually show what is wrong (QA Analysis failure telling me to look at the server log, then the server log shows me a nice stacktrace I don't understand without knowledge of JBOSS BRMS' insides)
- Error messages that suggest how to solve the problem.
- Show a "Would you like to save your changes?" window when closing a tab.
- Make it work correctly in Internet Explorer.

4) How was the documentation able to help?
   
Answer:
- No, I wasn't really aware there was any documentation.

5) Should their be self help, and what form would it take?
   
Answer:
- I don't really understand this question.

6) Did you use any of the testing features, how did you like them, what could be improved?

Answer:
- Yes, feedback could be improved. Now you will get an error that isn't really clear. Errors should suggest how to solve the problem, not only show the problem.

7) What did you expect to be able to do that you couldn't?

Answer:
- Modify a fact that inserted using the guided rule editor. I was able to solve this using a DSL, but that is way too cumbersome in some situations.

8) What was the biggest source of frustration?

Answer:
- Losing my repository... but, I got it back by exporting and importing again.
- Not knowing what I did wrong in DSLs. This took too much time to figure out (not good for production environments).
