Welcome, you should have a folder brms_lab in your home directory that contains
a JBoss EAP 4.3.0 installation already prepared with the JBoss BRMS 5.0 product.
Just follow the instructions below for the first lab session and good luck!

========================================================================
Before you can run the software installed on your accounts you need to login
on the Fedora Linux machines, reboot and choose Fedora from the boot menu if
you are in Windows.

1) Start the JBoss BRMS server:

 - brms_lab/jboss-eap-4.3/jboss-as/bin/run.sh

2) Login to JBoss BRMS at: 

 - http://localhost:8080/jboss-brms 
 - user: admin
 - pass: admin
 - accept and install sample repository when asked.

3) Create a new knowledge base:

 - Knowledge Bases -> Create New -> Package
 - name the package 'insurance'

4) Create a new category

 - Administration -> Category -> New Category
 - add 'insurance' 

5) Create two new facts in the insurance package:

 - Knowledge Bases -> Create New -> Declarative Model
 - name the model 'InsuranceModel'
 - add two facts to the model:
   - Add new fact type -> 'Driver'
     - add fields: driverName (String), age (Integer), ssn (String), dlNumber (String), 
                   numberOfAccidents (Integer), numberOfTickets (Integer), 
                   creditScore (Integer)
   - Add new fact type -> 'Policy'
     - add fields: requestDate (Date), policyType (String), vehicleYear (int), price (int)
 - save changes

6) Add business rules (don't forget to save changes):

Rule "SafeYouths"

If the driver age is between 18 and 24 and has no accidents and less than 2
tickets, then a policy costs 450.

Rule "RiskyYouths"

If the driver age is between 18 and 24 and has no accidents or has 2 or more
tickets, then a policy costs 700.

Rule "SafeAdults"

If the driver age is older than 24 and has no accidents and has less than 2
tickets, then a policy costs 120.


Rule "RiskyAdults"	

If the driver age is older than 24 and has at least 1 accidents or has more
than 2 tickets, then a policy costs 300.			

6) Create tests for the above rules:

 - Knowledge Bases -> insurance -> Test Scenarios -> Create New -> New Test Scenario

Grade:
=====
I will require two screen shots; one of your rules (overview only of all
rules) and one of the test suite run (showing green and coverage). I am
looking for as much coverage you can achieve. Good luck!
