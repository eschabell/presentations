Welcome, you should have a folder brms_lab in your home directory that contains
a JBoss EAP 4.3.0 installation already prepared with the JBoss BRMS 5.0 product.
Just follow the instructions below for the last lab session and good luck!

========================================================================
Before you can run the software installed on your accounts you need to login
on the Fedora Linux machines, reboot and choose Fedora from the boot menu if
you are in Windows.

1) Start the JBoss BRMS server:

 - brms_lab/jboss-eap-4.3/jboss-as/bin/run.sh

2) Login to JBoss BRMS at: 

 - http://localhost:8080/jboss-brms 
 - user: admin
 - pass: admin

3) Use all the experience you have gathered in the first two labs to implement
a new knowledge base with the exam regelment or library regulations as your
domain. Make use of the courses first assignment results (Rulespeak) to create
the following:

 - package
 - category / categories
 - rules
 - tests
 - no DSL creation required but possible extra credit for a working DSL!

Grade:
=====
I will grade based on how complete the knowledge base is. The final lab day
will be used to finish up this assignment and allow you to show me your
results for grading.
