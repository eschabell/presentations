As one of the top four Dutch financial institutions, SNS Bank in the
Netherlands made a strategic decision to use technology to empower its
customers online by fully automating its service and selling channels. In order
to effectively move towards a full-scale Straight Through Processing (STP)
experience, SNS Bank chose to achieve its goals by making use of Open Source
Software, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), and BPM.

This session will take us through the history of the SNS Bank, laying the
groundwork as to their vision and strategy. This will explain the move from a
traditional bank to a modern Internet bank providing innovative selling
channels. We will walk through the existing architecture, detailing the impact
this move has had on existing IT systems and the migration efforts to position
open source solutions. 

It goes without saying that these moves have had an effect on both the business
departments and customers from the SNS Bank. The major change from branch
offices to Internet selling channels required a new focus for the business
departments to be able to provide effective services to her customers.

Finally, a close look at the lessons learned along the way will provide you
with insight into a working open source STP BPM solution that is cost effective,
reliable, flexible, and tailored to evolve with SNS Bank into the future.
